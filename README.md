Blizzard API Testing
====================

Working with the Blizzard API for fun to see what kind of information we can extract from there. Starting small and then hopefully building up to something I can put in front of people.

For now I'll use the API to look up World of Warcraft characters.

Dec 6th: Finalized initial setup. Looking up a specific character and displaying the information. Will add more functionality at a later date. For now using custom css but will probably bootstrap it soon. 

March 1-3rd, 2016: Been working on this a lot the last couple of days. Added functionality to find out whether the user has a certain achievement or not and displaying a check mark or cross. Pulling up the character thumbnail. Added some user feedback for when we're searching for a character so they're not in the dark. Lots of CSS/HTML editing, and file structure clean up.

March 6th, 2016: This iteration of the app is done. There's more that could be added (like checking if they have the proper enchants) but for now I'm happy to leave it as is.
