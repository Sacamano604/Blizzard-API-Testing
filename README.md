Blizzard API Testing
====================

Working with the Blizzard API for fun to see what kind of information we can extract from there. Starting small and then hopefully building up to something I can put in front of people.

For now I'll use the API to look up World of Warcraft characters.

Dec 6th: Finalized inital setup. Looking up a specific character and displaying the information. Will add more functionality at a later date. For now using custom css but will probably bootstrap it soon.
